<h1>My Favourite Books</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Lord of the Rings</h2>
<p>Takes one through the beautiful mountains and forests of Middle Earth, 
    gives one a sense of purpose and bravery.</p>
<h2>Books about Pirates</h2>
<p>The wildest strongest characters you will never meet. Where the law is 
    what one do by their strength, wit and luck.</p>
<h2>Frankenstein</h2>
<p>The sience of language is left behind in favour of mechanics and 
    physics, but at out own peril. A novel where the author is pointing at 
    the ineptitude of languageis bold.</p>
